# TDA_code
In this project we use topological data analysis (TDA) to analyze and categorize the MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits. We also discuss 
two examples of other applications of TDA. The TDA package used is Ripser. The application of TDA to MNIST is my own work (although a similar analysis may have been done before). The example applications I discuss come from the TDA literature cited in the notebook.

The main file in the project is the MNIST_TDA.ipynb notebook. The other files are TDA_helper_functions.ipynb, image files used in the examples, 
and the MNIST data set.
